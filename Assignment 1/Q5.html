        Saturday was the second time this season Atlético have dropped points at 
        home when leading at any point. They have won four games when they have 
        taken the lead at any point. “Yes, it hurts me,” Diego Simeone said about 
        dropping points at home. Atlético  dominated Saturday’s game in many aspects. 
        They attempted 633 passes, their highest total in a single match in LaLiga 
        this season. But the fact remains Atlético’s home form is at a low point in 
        Simeone’s 10-plus years on the touchline. (Credits- IntoTheCalderon)
